2. Create a `.env` file in the client folder and add the following variables:
REACT_APP_STEAM_ID =
REACT_APP_RAWG_API_KEY =

3. Run `npm start` from the client folder to start the client. The project will now be running at http://localhost:3000.\
The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.
