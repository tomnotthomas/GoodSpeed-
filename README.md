# 🎮 Welcome to Swiff

Welcome to Swiff! The Game Streaming Platform for Mac Users - an innovative solution that integrates seamlessly with Steam 🚂 and leverages the Google Cloud Platform ☁️ to create powerful gaming servers. This platform is built using TypeScript, with a backend based on Express.js, and uses MongoDB and Mongoose for database management.

## 📁 Repository Structure

The repository is organized into a main folder named `Platform`, which contains two primary sub-folders:

- `client`: The frontend of the platform, written in TypeScript.
- `server`: The backend server, also written in TypeScript and using Express.js.

- `react-website`: A separate React-based web application for the project.

Each of these directories contains a dedicated `README.md` file with specific setup and configuration instructions.

### 💻 Client

The client is the interface for users to interact with the platform. It communicates with the Steam API and provides a seamless display of the gaming library, like Netflix.

- [Client README](Platform/client/README.md)

### 🖥️ Server

The server handles requests from the client, integrates with Google Cloud for server management, and uses MongoDB for data storage.

- [Server README](Platform/server/README.md)

### 🌐 React Website

The React website serves as an additional web interface for the platform, offering a user-friendly way to interact with our services.

- [React Website README](Platform/react-website/README.md)

- **Backend**: Express.js, MongoDB, Mongoose
- **Frontend**: TypeScript, Steam API
- **Cloud**: Google Cloud Platform
